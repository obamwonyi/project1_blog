                    <h3>What is Front-End Engineering in Web Dev ?</h3>
                    <p><blockquote>
                        Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of
                        producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user
                        can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end 
                        development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website 
                        change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
                        developing.
                        The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they
                        see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further
                        complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes 
                        and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. 
                        They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating 
                        systems (cross-platform)
                        and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
                            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by 
                            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as 
                            JavaScript.

                            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server 
                            or from local storage and render the documents into 
                            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web 
                            page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. 
                            With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms 
                            may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured 
                            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
                            links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
                            Tags such as &lt; img / &gt; and &lt; input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p>
                                surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                                Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects
                            the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
                            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS 
                            standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of 
                            HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt; canvas &gt; element, in
                                collaboration with javascript.

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                            CSS is designed to enable the separation 
                            of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This 
                            separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in
                            the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying 
                            the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
                            and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and 
                            its formatting.

                            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                            different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
                            (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has 
                            rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
                            than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

                            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet 
                            media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates 
                            a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

                            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML,
                        plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        <blockquote>
                            JavaScript  often abbreviated JS, 
                            is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
                            alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page 
                            behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
                            dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] 
                            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
                            supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces 
                            (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
                            (DOM).

                            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or 
                            graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

                            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers 
                            and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

                            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, 
                            the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
